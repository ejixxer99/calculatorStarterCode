# CalculatorStarterCode

The code for the calculator can do the four basic functions of Multiplication, division, addtion, and subtraction
along with some added extras.

Hopefully a function can be made to where the solution of one problem can be used in
another order of operations, in the same use. 

E.g. 
5+5=10;
ANS+3= 13
